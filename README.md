# Provus Interview Project: Setup

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Next, create a new branch with the following format: `name_location_role_provus_test`. Be sure to replace `name` with your own name, and `location` with your current location (e.g. city or country), `role` with your position or role on the project. This will help us to identify your branch and ensure that everyone is working on the correct code.
3. Choose your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and connect to the scratch org that you created.
4. Deploy the force-app to the scratch org to ensure that you have the latest code and can begin developing. 
5. Finally, assign the permission set `Provus_Quoting` to your scratch org User.


By following these instructions, you'll be able to set up your development environment and start working on the project right away.
